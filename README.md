# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-PySpark
This project leverages PySpark, a Python library for distributed computing, to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, followed by feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
This PySpark project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering. The dataset is then used to train machine learning models to predict customer churn. Finally, the models are evaluated to assess their performance in predicting churn accurately.
